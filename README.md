## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gym-landing.git
    cd gym-landing
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/gym-landing.git` with the actual repository URL if different.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install all required project dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will:
*   Start the Vite development server.
*   Open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173/` or a similar address).
*   Provide Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience, meaning changes you make to the code will instantly reflect in the browser without a full page reload.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile and bundle the application into the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

You can then preview the production build locally using:

```bash
npm run preview
```
